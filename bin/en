# Call emacsclient for the current tmux session. We're assuming that there is at
# least one emacs server running in each tmux session, that has been started
# with name "serverX", where X is the tmux session number, and we want to direct
# the emacsclient request to the corresponding server.
# This can be accomplished in Emacs by setting the variable "server-name".
#
# If this is not run in a tmux session, direct this to the default server.
#
# Note that we're passing in the user-supplied args, so if you don't want the
# emacsclient program to wait, you can use -n / --no-wait, for example.

# The current tmux session appears as the last comma-separated digit in the TMUX
# variable.
# Note: this expansion only works in bash.
